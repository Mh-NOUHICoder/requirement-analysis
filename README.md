# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository focuses on the Requirement Analysis phase in software development. 
It serves as a structured guide to document, analyze, and organize requirements for a booking management system project. 
The goal is to simulate a real-world scenario, emphasizing clarity and precision in defining system requirements for successful project execution.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, and defining the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software project. 
It ensures that the software being developed meets the business goals and user requirements effectively.

In the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), Requirement Analysis is a critical early phase because it:

- Clarifies project objectives and scope.
- Helps prevent misunderstandings between stakeholders and developers.
- Guides the design and development of the system by defining what needs to be built.
- Reduces errors, rework, and project risks by establishing a clear foundation for the software.

Overall, Requirement Analysis sets the stage for successful project execution by providing a structured approach to understanding and documenting what the system must achieve.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a crucial role in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It ensures that the project is built correctly and meets stakeholder expectations. Key reasons why it is important include:

1. **Clarifies Project Objectives**  
   Requirement Analysis helps clearly define what the software needs to achieve, aligning the development process with business goals.

2. **Prevents Errors and Reduces Rework**  
   By understanding requirements upfront, developers can avoid misunderstandings that could lead to costly mistakes and repeated work.

3. **Improves Communication Between Stakeholders**  
   Documenting requirements creates a shared understanding between developers, clients, and end-users, reducing conflicts and ensuring everyone is on the same page.

4. **Facilitates Project Planning and Resource Allocation**  
   Clear requirements help estimate time, cost, and resources accurately, ensuring efficient project management.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

The Requirement Analysis phase involves several key activities that ensure a clear understanding of what the system must achieve. These activities include:

- **Requirement Gathering:**  
  Collect stakeholders’ needs and expectations through interviews, surveys, workshops, and observation. This forms the foundation for all further analysis.

- **Requirement Elicitation:**  
  Refine and explore gathered requirements using techniques like brainstorming, prototyping, and use case discussions to uncover hidden or implicit needs.

- **Requirement Documentation:**  
  Create structured documents such as requirement specifications, user stories, and use case diagrams to clearly communicate the requirements to developers and stakeholders.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:**  
  Organize and model requirements to identify relationships, dependencies, and priorities. Tools like flowcharts, UML diagrams, and data models are commonly used.

- **Requirement Validation:**  
  Review requirements with stakeholders to ensure they are accurate, complete, and feasible. This step ensures that the documented requirements truly reflect stakeholder needs.

## Types of Requirements

Requirements in software development can be broadly categorized into **Functional** and **Non-functional** requirements. Understanding both types ensures that the system not only works correctly but also performs well under expected conditions.

### Functional Requirements
Functional requirements define the specific features and behavior of the system. They describe **what the system should do**.  

**Examples for the Booking Management System:**
- User Registration and Login
- Property Search and Filtering
- Booking and Reservation Management
- Payment Processing
- Sending Booking Confirmation Emails

### Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements define **how the system should perform** and the quality attributes it must satisfy. They ensure the system meets standards for usability, performance, and reliability.  

**Examples for the Booking Management System:**
- Page load time under 2 seconds
- Secure handling of user data (encryption)
- System availability 99.9% of the time
- Scalability to handle multiple bookings simultaneously
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop devices

## Use Case Diagrams

A **Use Case Diagram** is a visual representation of the interactions between users (actors) and a system. It shows the system’s key functionalities and how users engage with them. Use Case Diagrams are valuable because they:

- Provide a clear overview of the system’s functional requirements.
- Help stakeholders and developers understand user interactions.
- Highlight system boundaries and the relationship between actors and use cases.
- Serve as a foundation for detailed system design and testing.

### Example for Booking Management System

**Actors:**
- Guest (end-user)
- Admin
- Payment System

**Use Cases:**
- Register / Login
- Search Properties
- Book Property
- Make Payment
- Cancel Booking
- Manage Listings (Admin)

## Acceptance Criteria

**Acceptance Criteria** define the specific conditions that a software feature must satisfy to be accepted by stakeholders. They serve as a clear, measurable standard to determine whether a requirement has been successfully implemented.

**Importance in Requirement Analysis:**
- Ensures that developers and stakeholders have a shared understanding of what “done” means for each feature.
- Reduces ambiguity and misunderstandings during development.
- Provides a basis for testing and validation of features.
- Helps maintain quality and consistency across the system.

**Example – Checkout Feature (Booking Management System):**
- The user can select a property and specify booking dates.
- Payment is processed securely and confirmed.
- A booking confirmation email is sent to the user within 1 minute.
- Users can view their booking details in their account dashboard.
- Cancellation and refund options are available according to the policy.
